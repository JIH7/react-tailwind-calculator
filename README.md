# Simple Calculator
This is based on a challenge from Frontend Mentor. I once did this exact same challenge with plain HTML/CSS/JS, but that was in the days before I made a habit of using source control, so it's been lost. I really liked the look of this calculator, and I had recently learened Tailwind and wanted to learn React, so I decided to use them for this project. This was my very first time using react for anything. I just went off of the docs and some YouTube tutorials, and I'm very happy with the end result.

If you'd like to download and run this, just use the command "npm run dev" to host it locally or "npm run build" and host the contents of the "dist" folder on your platform of choice.

This is a very simple web based calculator with a color picker. It is responsive and looks good on mobile. There are a few desktop screen sizes that currently don't look exactly as intended quite yet, but it should look great on most screens.
